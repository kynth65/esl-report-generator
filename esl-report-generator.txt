## 1. Project Name
ESL Report Generator – Multi-Level Summarization System

## 2. Project Summary
A web app where teachers can generate three different types of reports:
- **Daily Progress Summary** - Upload individual lesson reports for daily summaries
- **Monthly Progress Summary** - Aggregate monthly performance overview  
- **Monthly Comparison Report** - Compare current month vs previous month performance

Each page will have its own upload functionality and generate specific report types with homework worksheets.
